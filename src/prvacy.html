            <b>Data sharing.</b>
            Information about your use of this site (the pages you visited, your IP
            address, your browser version, etc.) is shared with Google for the
            purposes of analyzing traffic (Google Analytics) and serving ads. None

            <b>Personalized ads.</b> In order to show you the most relevant ads,
            Google tries to figure out what kinds of goods and services you may be
            interested in. It does so by collecting certain information about you –
            for example, your geographical location, your Google searches, and your
            visits to this and other websites. This information does not include
            your name, address, email address or telephone number. Google will use
            this information when deciding which ads to show you when you visit this
            site.
