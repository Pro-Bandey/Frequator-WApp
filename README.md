# 🎵 [Tone Generator](https://pro-bandey.github.io/Frequator-WApp/) — Safety, Instructions & Uses

---

## ⚠️ Hearing & Equipment Safety

Playing tones at **extreme volumes** can damage **your hearing** or **your speakers**.

- Humans generally cannot hear sounds **below 20 Hz** or **above 10,000 Hz** very well.
- Increasing volume to compensate for inaudible frequencies can:
  - Expose your ears to **harmful sound levels**
  - Subject speakers to **dangerous electrical currents**

### ✅ Stay Safe
- Find a **comfortable volume level** using a **1,000 Hz tone**
- Do **not exceed this level**, even if:
  - You can’t hear much sound
  - You’re testing high frequencies (where hearing is most fragile)

## ▶️ How to Use the Tone Generator

### 🎶 Play Controls
- **Play / Pause:** Click **Play** or press **Space**

### 🎚️ Frequency Adjustment
- **Drag the slider** or press **← / →**
- **±1 Hz:** Buttons or **Shift + ← / →**
- **±0.01 Hz:** **Ctrl + ← / →**
- **±0.001 Hz:** **Ctrl + Shift + ← / →**
- **Octave shift:**
  - **×½** → Half the frequency
  - **×2** → Double the frequency

### 🌊 Wave Types
Switch from a **sine wave (pure tone)** to:
- Square
- Triangle
- Sawtooth  
by clicking the **Wave** button

### 🎛️ Mix Multiple Tones
- Open the **Frequator WApp** in **multiple browser tabs**

## 🧪 What Can You Use This For?

### 🎼 Music & Audio
- Instrument tuning
- Testing speakers and headphones
- Finding subwoofer frequency limits

### 🔬 Science & Learning
- Resonance experiments  
  *(e.g., finding the resonant frequency of a wine glass)*

### 👂 Hearing Tests
- Determine the **highest frequency** you can hear
- Detect **ear-specific frequency perception**

## 🔔 Tinnitus Frequency Matching

If you have **pure-tone tinnitus**, this tool can help identify its frequency.

### Why It Helps
- Enables better **masking sound selection**
- Supports **frequency discrimination training**

### Important Tip
When you find a matching tone:
- Also test:
  - **One octave higher (×2)**
  - **One octave lower (×½)**
  
> Tones one octave apart are often confused.

## 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Research (Experimental)

Researchers at **MIT** are studying whether **40 Hz tones** can reverse certain molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease.

- 🧪 **Animal studies** (transgenic mice) showed promising results
- 👥 **Early human trials** are inconclusive
- 🔍 Further research is ongoing

> ⚠️ This tone generator is **not a medical device** and **no guarantees** are made.
